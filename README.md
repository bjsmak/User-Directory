# User Directory

By having multiple users or employees in a directory, a user needs an option to sort or filter through the different categories as they please. This is accomplished through the use of React in this project. By using the basics of hooks and states, the components were structured so that the randomuser API generated into a table with 100 random users. Then, the user is either able to search by first name in the text box with a filter or click to sort the first names alphabetically.
